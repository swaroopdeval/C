#[Largest palindrome product](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler004)
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is **_101101 = 143×707_**.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than **_N_**.

######Input Format
First line contains **_T_** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by **_T_** lines, each containing an integer, **_N_**.

######Output Format
Print the required answer for each test case in a new line.
