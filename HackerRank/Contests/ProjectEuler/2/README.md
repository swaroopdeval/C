#Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

**_1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,⋯_**

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

######Input Format
First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

######Output Format
Print the required answer for each test case.
