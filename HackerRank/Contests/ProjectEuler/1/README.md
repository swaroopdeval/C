#Project Euler #1: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below **_N_**.

######Input Format
First line contains **_T_** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by **_T_** lines, each containing an integer, **_N_**.

######Output Format
For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below **_N_**.
